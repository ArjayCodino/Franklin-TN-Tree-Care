                <p>Maintaining the value of your home goes beyond taking care of your house. The property surrounding your house also holds value and if properly cared for can increase the value of your home. This is why caring for the land and what is growing on it is so important, especially if you have trees.
                </p><br>
                <p>Trees can add curb appeal and valuable shade to your property, they can also be the source of costly damage. Being able to identify if a tree can add value or end up costing you, can save you time and lots of money. In most cases a tree that needs maintenance or adds to the privacy and comfort of your property has long term value.</p><br>
                <p>Here are few things to look out for when you have trees on your property.
                    1. The most obvious thing to look for is healthy growth. If your tree doesn’t have anything growing from its branches during the spring to fall seasons this is a pretty sure sign that your tree is either dead or has some kind of disease. Taking a close look at the tree to see if there is any strange growth, unnatural holes or milled lines in its bark is a good way to identify if there is a bug or disease that has killed the tree. If this is the case, this disease will likely spread to a nearby tree resulting in more damage. If the damage seems minimal trimming back those areas and burning or properly removing the debris can be done on your own. But if the damage is wide spread or the tree is dead, the best thing to do is to hire a professional. </p><br></section>

                        <section style="padding-left: 15%;padding-right: 15%;">
                        <p>2. If there is a tree that is close to a house or other structure with branches that over reach that structure, there is a chance that damage from high winds or a storm might take that branch out causing it to fall and damage what lies beneath. To prevent this possible damage, it is best to have those branches removed. In most cases, it is best to have a professional trim or remove the branches to avoid any property damage.
                        </p><br>

                        <p>3. If you have a tree that is near any incoming electrical or cable lines to your house, you may be responsible for any damage that is done to the lines on your property. Trees tend to get tangled in these lines. If there is any kind of heavy winds or storm, branches may break, taking down those lines resulting in costly damage and possible power loss.  It is extremely important to NOT attempt to trim branches around electrical lines yourself, always hire a professional tree expert to handle these areas.

                        <p>3. Planting a tree in the right location can make all difference to its future growth. If you have a tree that doesn’t seem to be growing, which does take time, the problem might be in its location or in the soil. Identifying these issues can sometimes be difficult and applying the wrong treatment could be detrimental to the trees health. Hiring a professional to assess your situation can make all the difference and save you years of lost growth.

                            <p>There are many reasons you might maintain property, either by taking pride in your yard or perhaps you do so professionally. And while you likely have cut your grass down to an art, most people just don’t know how to care for their trees.
                            </p><br>
                            <p>That rarely stops them from hacking off branches and limbs with chainsaws or hedgers, even if they have no clue what they are cutting. All too often, someone lops off a terminal branch and kills it off despite being in otherwise excellent condition.</p><br>
                            <p>The only way of knowing what to do to maintain your curb appeal is learning the basics of proper weekly tree care needs. In no time, you’ll have the best-looking lot on the block, all without much additional effort.</p><br><p>Add these items to your weekly list of chores to make your lawns appear even better. And for everything else, you can always rely on Franklin TN Tree Care.

                        <p>Following a severe storm or unexpected cold snap, you’ve likely had someone knock on your door offering to cut your dead trees down. They pitch you a price you can’t turn down, and you hire them on the spot.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>However, it isn’t until you hear a loud crash and broken glass do you think to ask about licensing and insurance. By then it’s too late to realize that they’re just someone with a chainsaw in hand, and now you’re liable for fixing the damage down to your neighbor’s property.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Before a cheap tree removal contractor makes a costly error, do your research before hiring someone. If nothing else, ask the door-to-door landscaper for a business card to learn if they are legitimate or not.</p></section>

                                <p style="padding-left: 10%;padding-right: 0%;">Some homeowners consistently take off too many limbs at once, while others rarely prune their plants at all. Both schools of thinking are putting their trees at risk, and these residents would do themselves a favor to learn the best practices. <br>
                                    <br>Trimming and pruning should be a necessary part of any upkeep plan, but it’s likely something that you’ve long forgotten about until it’s far overgrown. By then, you can only hope that a professional service can shape it back to normal without incident. <br> 
                                    <br>At least once a month during the tree’s hot season growing pattern, clip off any dead plant material or overly long limbs. By carefully shaping up the outer parameter and clearing away unneeded sections, you can promote many weeks of increased growth. <br>
                                    <br>However, it’s also easy to trim incorrectly, and one wrong snip can cause lasting damage. Make sure to educate yourself how before pruning your trees, or else leave it to the Franklin tree trimming experts. <br></p>

                                    <p>You may have recently hired a company to cut down a dead or dying tree. However, what you didn’t realize is that it will require another stump removal Brentwood service to take care of the rest <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Most tree removal companies will not take away the stump unless you agree to it as a separate job. And while that may seem unfair at first, anyone who has had to do it by themselves will tell you it’s well worth the cost.
                                        <br>
                                        <p>Some stumps get simpler to remove than others, and you may find that a grinder would be the best method to get rid of it. However, you may have a challenging time finding an equipment rental center that has one. <br>
                                            <p>Instead, hiring a professional company is often the most cost-effective way to remove stumps from yards. Otherwise, you could be at it for days with little more than bruises and damaged vehicle bumpers to show for it. <br>

                            <p>Although trees use thick bark as protection, their most vulnerable areas are still their root systems. As is the case with other plants in your backyard, roots stay easily damaged by pests, temperature changes, and too much moisture.
                            </p><br>
                            <p>You may think that because the ground covers them that there’s nothing more to do on your part. However, installing mulch remains one of the frequently recommended yard care solutions with more landscaping services.</p><br>
                            <p>Mulching both keeps roots better defended from physical harm, but it also creates a blanket, keeping them warm during winter. That will allow all of your trees a better odds at surviving the harshest winters possible. </p><br><p>You can find mulching at nearly any retail center, although for the best results, you’d want to use fresh products. Over time, mulch can lose nutrients while sitting on store shelves.</p><br><p>Whether you have questions regarding trees or you’d like to hire us for your yards, call <a href="https://www.treecarefranklintn.com/  "> <span style="color: b0000ff;"><b>Franklin TN Tree Care.</b></span></a>
